# Doma Auction Platform

## Hackathon Submission

### Doma Usage
This project leverages the Doma testnet for decentralized property auctions. Smart contracts are deployed on Doma, enabling transparent bidding, auction management, and on-chain revenue tracking. All auction logic, user bids, and revenue metrics are powered by Domaâ€™s EVM-compatible infrastructure.

### Track Goals
Our submission addresses the goals of the selected track by:
- Enabling trustless property auctions using Doma smart contracts
- Providing real-time metrics for transactions, users, and revenue
- Integrating wallet connectivity and contract interactions for seamless user experience
- Demonstrating how Doma can be used for real-world asset tokenization and auctioning
